## Tips for high-performance metric collection {#tips-for-high-performance-metric-collection}

Running a new process each time you want to update metrics is
(relatively) expensive. If you want to collect metrics at high
resolutions, and/or over a large number of containers (think 1000
containers on a single host), you don't want to fork a new process each
time.

Here is how to collect metrics from a single process. You need to
write your metric collector in C (or any language that lets you do
low-level system calls). You need to use a special system call,
`setns()`, which lets the current process enter any
arbitrary namespace. It requires, however, an open file descriptor to
the namespace pseudo-file (remember: that's the pseudo-file in
`/proc/<pid>/ns/net`).

However, there is a catch: you must not keep this file descriptor open.
If you do, when the last process of the control group exits, the
namespace isn't destroyed, and its network resources (like the
virtual interface of the container) stays around forever (or until
you close that file descriptor).

The right approach would be to keep track of the first PID of each
container, and re-open the namespace pseudo-file each time.

## Collect metrics when a container exits {#collect-metrics-when-a-container-exits}

Sometimes, you don't care about real time metric collection, but when a
container exits, you want to know how much CPU, memory, etc. it has
used.

Docker makes this difficult because it relies on `lxc-start`, which carefully
cleans up after itself. It is usually easier to collect metrics at regular
intervals, and this is the way the `collectd` LXC plugin works.

But, if you'd still like to gather the stats when a container stops,
here is how:

For each container, start a collection process, and move it to the
control groups that you want to monitor by writing its PID to the tasks
file of the cgroup. The collection process should periodically re-read
the tasks file to check if it's the last process of the control group.
(If you also want to collect network statistics as explained in
[Network metrics](network-metrics.md), you should also move the process to the appropriate
network namespace.)

When the container exits, `lxc-start` attempts to
delete the control groups. It fails, since the control group is
still in use; but that's fine. Your process should now detect that it is
the only one remaining in the group. Now is the right time to collect
all the metrics you need!

Finally, your process should move itself back to the root control group,
and remove the container control group. To remove a control group, just
`rmdir` its directory. It's counter-intuitive to
`rmdir` a directory as it still contains files; but
remember that this is a pseudo-filesystem, so usual rules don't apply.
After the cleanup is done, the collection process can exit safely.
