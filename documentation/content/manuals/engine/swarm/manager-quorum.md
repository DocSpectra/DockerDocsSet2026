title: Plan Swarm managers and maintain quorum
---

## Operate manager nodes in a swarm

Swarm manager nodes use the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](raft.md) to manage the
swarm state. You only need to understand some general concepts of Raft in
order to manage a swarm.

There is no limit on the number of manager nodes. The decision about how many
manager nodes to implement is a trade-off between performance and
fault-tolerance. Adding manager nodes to a swarm makes the swarm more
fault-tolerant. However, additional manager nodes reduce write performance
because more nodes must acknowledge proposals to update the swarm state.
This means more network round-trip traffic.

Raft requires a majority of managers, also called the quorum, to agree on
proposed updates to the swarm, such as node additions or removals. Membership
operations are subject to the same constraints as state replication.

### Maintain the quorum of managers

If the swarm loses the quorum of managers, the swarm cannot perform management
tasks. If your swarm has multiple managers, always have more than two.
To maintain quorum, a majority of managers must be available. An odd number of
managers is recommended, because the next even number does not make the quorum
easier to keep. For instance, whether you have 3 or 4 managers, you can still
only lose 1 manager and maintain the quorum. If you have 5 or 6 managers, you
can still only lose two.

Even if a swarm loses the quorum of managers, swarm tasks on existing worker
nodes continue to run. However, swarm nodes cannot be added, updated, or
removed, and new or existing tasks cannot be started, stopped, moved, or
updated.

## Configure the manager to advertise on a static IP address

When initiating a swarm, you must specify the `--advertise-addr` flag to
advertise your address to other manager nodes in the swarm. For more
information, see [Run Docker Engine in swarm mode](advertise-address.md). Because manager nodes are
meant to be a stable component of the infrastructure, you should use a *fixed
IP address* for the advertise address to prevent the swarm from becoming
unstable on machine reboot.

If the whole swarm restarts and every manager node subsequently gets a new IP
address, there is no way for any node to contact an existing manager. Therefore
the swarm is hung while nodes try to contact one another at their old IP addresses.

Dynamic IP addresses are OK for worker nodes.

## Add manager nodes for fault tolerance

You should maintain an odd number of managers in the swarm to support manager
node failures. Having an odd number of managers ensures that during a network
partition, there is a higher chance that the quorum remains available to process
requests if the network is partitioned into two sets. Keeping the quorum is not
guaranteed if you encounter more than two network partitions.

| Swarm Size |  Majority  |  Fault Tolerance  |
|:------------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
|      1       |     1      |         0         |
|      2       |     2      |         0         |
|    **3**     |     2      |       **1**       |
|      4       |     3      |         1         |
|    **5**     |     3      |       **2**       |
|      6       |     4      |         2         |
|    **7**     |     4      |       **3**       |
|      8       |     5      |         3         |
|    **9**     |     5      |       **4**       |

For example, in a swarm with *5 nodes*, if you lose *3 nodes*, you don't have a
quorum. Therefore you can't add or remove nodes until you recover one of the
unavailable manager nodes or recover the swarm with disaster recovery
commands.

While it is possible to scale a swarm down to a single manager node, it is
impossible to demote the last manager node. This ensures you maintain access to
the swarm and that the swarm can still process requests. Scaling down to a
single manager is an unsafe operation and is not recommended. If
the last node leaves the swarm unexpectedly during the demote operation, the
swarm becomes unavailable until you reboot the node or restart with
`--force-new-cluster`.

You manage swarm membership with the `docker swarm` and `docker node`
subsystems. 

### Distribute manager nodes

In addition to maintaining an odd number of manager nodes, pay attention to
datacenter topology when placing managers. For optimal fault-tolerance, distribute
manager nodes across a minimum of 3 availability-zones to support failures of an
entire set of machines or common maintenance scenarios. If you suffer a failure
in any of those zones, the swarm should maintain the quorum of manager nodes
available to process requests and rebalance workloads.

| Swarm manager nodes |  Repartition (on 3 Availability zones) |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| 3                   |                  1-1-1                 |
| 5                   |                  2-2-1                 |
| 7                   |                  3-2-2                 |
| 9                   |                  3-3-3                 |

### Run manager-only nodes

By default manager nodes also act as a worker nodes. This means the scheduler
can assign tasks to a manager node. For small and non-critical swarms
assigning tasks to managers is relatively low-risk as long as you schedule
services using resource constraints for cpu and memory.

However, because manager nodes use the Raft consensus algorithm to replicate data
in a consistent way, they are sensitive to resource starvation. You should
isolate managers in your swarm from processes that might block swarm
operations like swarm heartbeat or leader elections.

To avoid interference with manager node operation, you can drain manager nodes
to make them unavailable as worker nodes:

```console
$ docker node update --availability drain <NODE>
```

When you drain a node, the scheduler reassigns any tasks running on the node to
other available worker nodes in the swarm. It also prevents the scheduler from
assigning tasks to the node.
