Reliable information sources are key for Docker Scout's ability to
surface relevant and accurate assessments of your software artifacts.
Given the diversity of sources and methodologies in the industry,
discrepancies in vulnerability assessment results can and do happen.
This page describes how the Docker Scout advisory database
and its CVE-to-package matching approach works to deal with these discrepancies.

## Advisory database sources

Docker Scout aggregates vulnerability data from multiple sources.
The data is continuously updated to ensure that your security posture
is represented using the latest available information, in real-time.

Docker Scout uses the following package repositories and security trackers:

When you enable Docker Scout for your Docker organization,
a new database instance is provisioned on the Docker Scout platform.
The database stores the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and other metadata about your images.
When a security advisory has new information about a vulnerability,
your SBOM is cross-referenced with the CVE information to detect how it affects you.

## Severity and scoring priority

Docker Scout uses two main principles when determining severity and scoring for
CVEs:

   - Source priority
   - CVSS version preference

For source priority, Docker Scout follows this order:

  1. Vendor advisories: Scout always uses the severity and scoring data from the
     source that matches the package and version. For example, Debian data for
     Debian packages.

  2. NIST scoring data: If the vendor doesn't provide scoring data for a CVE,
     Scout falls back to NIST scoring data.

For CVSS version preference, once Scout has selected a source, it prefers CVSS
v4 over v3 when both are available, as v4 is the more modern and precise scoring
model.

## Vulnerability matching

Traditional tools often rely on broad [Common Product Enumeration (CPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Platform_Enumeration) matching,
which can lead to many false-positive results.

Docker Scout uses [Package URLs (PURLs)](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)
to match packages against CVEs, which yields more precise identification of vulnerabilities.
PURLs significantly reduce the chances of false positives, focusing only on genuinely affected packages.

## Supported package ecosystems

Docker Scout supports the following package ecosystems:

- .NET
- GitHub packages
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- RPM
- Ruby
- `alpm` (Arch Linux)
- `apk` (Alpine Linux)
- `deb` (Debian Linux and derivatives)

## Vulnerability severity assessment

Docker Scout assigns a severity rating to vulnerabilities based on
vulnerability data from [advisory sources](/manuals/scout/deep-dive/advisory-db-sources.md).
Advisories are ranked and prioritized depending on the type of package that's
affected by a vulnerability. For example, if a vulnerability affects an OS
package, the severity level assigned by the distribution maintainer is
prioritized.

If the preferred advisory source has assigned a severity rating to a CVE, but
not a CVSS score, Docker Scout falls back to displaying a CVSS score from
another source. The severity rating from the preferred advisory and the CVSS
score from the fallback advisory are displayed together. This means a
vulnerability can have a severity rating of `LOW` with a CVSS score of 9.8, if
the preferred advisory assigns a `LOW` rating but no CVSS score, and a fallback
advisory assigns a CVSS score of 9.8.

Vulnerabilities that haven't been assigned a CVSS score in any source are
categorized as **Unspecified** (U).

Docker Scout doesn't implement a proprietary vulnerability metrics system. All
metrics are inherited from security advisories that Docker Scout integrates
with. Advisories may use different thresholds for classifying vulnerabilities,
but most of them adhere to the CVSS v3.0 specification, which maps CVSS scores
to severity ratings according to the following table:

| CVSS score | Severity rating  |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0.1 – 3.9  | **Low** (L)      |
| 4.0 – 6.9  | **Medium** (M)   |
| 7.0 – 8.9  | **High** (H)     |
| 9.0 – 10.0 | **Critical** (C) |

For more information, see [Vulnerability Metrics (NIST)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss).

Note that, given the advisory prioritization and fallback mechanism described
earlier, severity ratings displayed in Docker Scout may deviate from this
rating system.
